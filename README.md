# CatPhotoApp 🐱

This is my **first webpage** built with HTML.  
It’s a simple project where I practiced using:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Images
- Lists
- Semantic tags like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<footer>`

## 📌 About
I made this project as my **first step in web development**.  
The goal was to learn the basics of HTML structure and create a fun webpage about cats. 🐾s
